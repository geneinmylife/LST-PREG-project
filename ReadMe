# `Sex-Stratified Genetic Analyses Mapping the Influences of Sedentary Behaviors and Physical Activity on Female Reproductive Health`

## Overview
This repository contains genome-wide association study (GWAS) and Mendelian Randomization (MR) code for a study investigating the causal relationships between sedentary behaviours, physical activity and risks of pregnancy-related disorders. 
Key findings of our study include:

```r
- 18 novel sex-stratified variants were identified in our sex-stratified GWAS. 
- LST exhibits higher heritability in females compared to males.
- Female-specific genetic instruments reveal that higher LST increases risks of menorrhagia, endometriosis, PCOS and ectopic pregnancy.
- LST exceeding 4 hours/day elevates menorrhagia and endometriosis risk.

## Installation
- R (≥4.0)
- Required R packages:
  ```R
  install.packages("remotes")
  remotes::install_github("MRCIEU/TwoSampleMR")  # Core MR analysis
  install.packages("dplyr")                      # Data manipulation
   #other packages are listed in each code.

##The following code were used in this study:
 1. gwas_code.sh: To conduct a sex-stratified GWAS on sedentary behaviours and physical activity from the UK Biobank database with REGENIE.
 2. GCTA_cojo_code.sh: To identify the instrument variables of exposures.
 3. Post-GWAS analysis.R: To calculate heritability and cross-trait genetic correlations.
 4. MR analysis.R: To identify causal effect between female LST and reproductive outcomes, including univariate MR, Multivariable MR and nonlinear MR.
